I've never had a blog before, even though I had thoughts. Thoughts which were more often than not
amorphous — indubitably due to the fact that I never once stopped to articulate them. I was (still
am) a coward. Putting my writing out in public is difficult. What if the things that I write about
are so uninteresting and at most, serve as mere proxies which others used to gauge what a
insight-porn-ish nitwit I am.

Everything I can imagine saying or writing sounds cringey or content-free. Did you know there are
different kinds of dashes: — - – (em dash, normal dash, en dash)? I did not.

I'm also terrible in the subtle art of nonstandard sentence construction. Instead of picking words
that maximize meaning and value for the readers, I pick words that fit the metre and rhyme scheme.

## Why now

The main trigger was when I got to read [Ben's sagely advice](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/) on
blogging as an awesome avenue to gain even more awesome friendships.\*

Points by Ben that made way too much sense when playing out to their logical conclusions:

- around 25% of his friends, he either first met them through one of his blogs OR
- his friendships was significantly reinforced by commenting on each other's posts
- another 25% or more he met indirectly through one of these people (who are disproportionately
  likely to have friends that he like a lot)

This is important. Over the course of my life, I realized that I deeply value friendship.

## Reciprocal Arrangements

> In the hierarchy of relationships, friendships are at the bottom. Romantic partners, parents,
> children — all these come first. [^1]

The poignant point about friendships lies in its inherent voluntary nature. Since you can choose to
enter, you can also choose to get out. There are no fail-safes in friendships, unlike in other kinds
of relationships e.g., marriages, birth families, business partners.

Some time back, I was asked if I thought of Person X as a friend or acquaintance. I was puzzled
because weren't everyone **friends**? Isn't someone a friend if this is a person 1) I've talked to
before and 2) bear no negative sentiments towards? Hmm...

Our world is a high-dimensional one. Any number of factors could conceivably matter when it comes to
the quality of a relationship between you and another party. The graph below presents a more
mathetical sketch and decidedly stronger babble and prune filter (to me) when I'm stuck between
pursuing or dropping this budding acquaintance-friendship.

So, on to the hunt for my sources of enjoyment, and thereby establishing which billions of variables
in the universe are actually relevant to me when it comes to people I want to be friends with.

## Everybody worships

Based on personal experience, a directly relevant variable i.e., which variables mediate the
influence of everything else, boils down to **the choice of what they think about**. What they
consciously decide has meaning and what doesn't. It is usually a direct forerunner to an estimate of
their internal mental patterns — emotions, engagement, thoughts/worries etc. Their curiosity,
**hilarity**[^2] or exhilarating verbal facility.

One thing I care about in friends is whether we'll have interesting conversations. I become
especially invigorated, whenever such interactions temporarily prove/disprove hypotheses I have.

Other things that matter to me: taste[^4];self-knowledge and reflective mindset; the confidence and
the ability to project self-assurance; the ability to read others and empathize with their point of
view; and a capacity to tolerate conflict. Intelligence, while an importance attribute, is
overrated.

The bottom line is basically somebody to talk to, someone to depend on and somebody to enjoy. Across
the entire life course, these expectations remain the same, but the circumstances under which
they're accomplished change.

### Relevant objections

#### "BORING PEOPLE FIND OTHERS BORING"

It's true that sometimes, we might be over presumptuous in holding some kinds of inclinations as
superior to others. Some people prefer to spend their free time checking social media and getting
sad. Others prefer to read books [^5]. Who's to decide which one is interesting/better?

But I disagree that there are no boring people. I don't mean to be binary about this. You can be
simultaneously boring and unboring. People are mercifully, individuals with loves and hates,
ambitions and generosity, potential and idlesness all mixed up inside them.

And sometimes, I get stuck in a group conversation with people I don't find interesting. The topics,
meh. The people, meh. The vibe, meh. I'm meh sometimes too.

Maybe its age, but I've started giving more conscious thought to my conduct and what the sum of all
my choices added up to be. Some say that rather than changing from the inside out, you bring the
outside in.

## Cities and Circuses

According to PG, different cities whispers different things to you. The kind of conversations you
overhear tell you the kinds of people you are around.

Whether I like it or not, it's hard not to be influenced by those around me. When I pay attention to
what I do and say, I feel a state of internal division and weakness that sets me further away from a
meta goal of mine: "to live in truth" — to act diligently towards some well-articulated, defined and
temporary end. The feeling of alienation when no one around me cares about the same things as I do,
is also bitter. And I wonder why my consumption of desserts has gone up...

> A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see through windows, in conversations you
> overhear. It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off. One of the
> occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the conversations of people who use

As Feynman once said, the first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the
easiest person to fool. Anyway, this first blog post is in hope of laying down a trail for others to
follow, if they want to.

I will be making my own criteria for **failure** and success timely and clear, at least for myself.
Though, a side-goal would also be for others to understand what I am doing, so that you can evaluate
together with me.

That said, any first-person text has a narrator of questionable credibility because humans tend to
rationalise, justify and explain away some of our conduct and decisions. How reliable am I? Am I a
believable three dimensional character that makes you want to keep reading what I expound on? I
don't dwell on these type of questions for too long. Else, I'll go mad or become a post-modern
philosopher.
