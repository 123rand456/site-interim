Putting my writing out in public is difficult. Everything I can imagine saying or writing sounds
cringey or content-free. I'm also terrible in the subtle art of nonstandard sentence construction.
Instead of picking words that maximize meaning and value for the readers, I pick words that fit the
metre and rhyme scheme. Yet, nobody cares. So here goes.

I got to read [Ben's sagely advice](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/) on blogging as an awesome
avenue to gain even more **awesome** friendships. Social media, I don't take to it as a way to forge
meaningful friendships or connections (at least for me).

- Around 25% of his friends, he either first met them through one of his blogs
- His friendships was significantly reinforced by commenting on each other's posts
- Another 25% or more he met indirectly through one of these people (who are disproportionately
  likely to have friends that he like a lot)

Looking back on the kinds of _"friendships"_ that I've held on to, I got sick of going _above and
beyond_ (very loosely defined). The overcompensation here probably stemmed from some past
introspection on how much I wasn’t showing up for others when I was younger. When effort didn't
translate into my desired outcomes, my mind linked the loss to my lowest self: “It happened because
I wasn’t enough.” Because shouldn't real friendships and kinships be resilient enough to withstand
your hard times, at least a little? _“Maybe I don’t weigh that high in their priority list.”_ That’s
a brutal conclusion, and one that’s hard to unlearn. I sometimes envy those whose careers grew
beside their friendships; how they built both craft and kinship in tandem.

## Hierarchy of relationships

> Romantic partners, parents, children — all these come first. [^1]

The poignant point about friendships lies in its inherent voluntary nature. There are no fail-safes
in friendships, unlike in other kinds of relationships e.g., marriages, birth families, business
partners. Our cultural script has taught that “family” is supposed to be the most natural,
automatic, unconditional bond. But in reality, real connection requires shared values, emotional
safety, and mutual curiosity. If that’s missing, even if people are kind or well-meaning, you can
feel alone in the same room.

Our world is a high-dimensional one. Any number of factors could conceivably matter when it comes to
the quality of a relationship between you and another party. The graph below helps when I'm stuck
between pursuing or dropping this budding acquaintance-friendship.

Friendships are meant to be spaces where you feel more like yourself, not less. If being around
people makes you feel like you're hiding or enduring something, then it means you're either with the
wrong people, or still working on being safe enough with yourself to show up as you are. Or both.

## Kinds of people that are "uh... Nah" for me

Those who listen only to respond, who compress others into neat categories for easier handling. They
mistake earnestness for naivety. They often confuse quick judgment for discernment, and tend to
flatten everything into a teachable moment. There’s a kind of quiet shoeboxing that happens, where a
person’s complexity gets packed away into a single, comfortable label.

I find that conversations with such people rarely breathe. Everything becomes an evaluation instead
of an exchange; a performance of understanding rather than the real thing. I prefer people who
engage with things, not over them; who can hold curiosity without needing to assert hierarchy. It’s
not that I need to be agreed with. I just need to feel that the other person is listening. I’m not
asking for perfect sympathy, only reciprocity, a willingness to be surprised, to stay a little
uncertain together.

## Everybody worships

Based on personal experience, what they consciously decide has meaning and what doesn't, is usually
a direct forerunner to an estimate of their internal mental patterns i.e., curiosity,
**hilarity**[^2] or verbal facility.

> If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will
> never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and

## What genuinely makes my inner world soften:

- Calm, slow energy, not hyper or performative
- Slightly awkward or introverted but self-aware
- Soft-spoken or thoughtful in conversation
- A quiet kind of confidence (not cocky, just settled)
- Makes space for my thoughts without needing to fix them
- Doesn’t over-praise, just sees me and treats that as enough
- Gives attention without making me feel scrutinized
- Generous in spirit, helps without making it a performance
- **Taste**[^4] and aesthetic sensibility
- **Conflict tolerance** - a capacity to handle disagreement constructively
- Doesn't gossip to belittle others

The bottom line is basically somebody to talk to, someone to depend on and somebody to enjoy. Across
the entire life course, these expectations remain the same, but the circumstances under which
they're accomplished change.

### Relevant objections

It's true that sometimes, we might be over presumptuous in holding some kinds of inclinations as
superior to others. Who's to decide which one is interesting/better? But I disagree that there are
no boring people. I don't mean to be binary about this. You can be simultaneously boring and
unboring. People are mercifully, individuals with loves and hates,ambitions and generosity,
potential and idlesness all mixed up inside them.

Sometimes, I get stuck in a group conversation with people I don't find interesting. The topics,
meh. The people, meh. The vibe, meh. I could be meh too. Some say that rather than changing from the
inside out, you bring the outside in. You might have had some of these friendships that I'm about to
touch on. Or currently, in some of them.

#### Actively draining friendships

These are the ones that actually chip away at your self-worth. You leave interactions feeling worse
about yourself (anxious, small, dismissed). They may criticize, compete, gossip, or only reach out
when they want something. You feel like you’re working during the friendship: managing their moods,
overgiving, keeping peace.

#### Flat friendships

There's no hostility, but also no spark. Conversations feel shallow or repetitive. You don’t feel
seen in your real self. You don’t leave drained, just indifferent.

Granted, we might tip into over-critical / guilt-tripping territory. So, how do I minimize the
extent of this? There are some behaviours I'm trying to default to.

1. Instead of labeling someone as “bad”, I'm trying to consciously note it as a pattern that doesn’t
   match my values or energy. Does noticing this pattern drain me or help me decide where to invest?
   It's healthy if it’s helping me choose where to spend energy. But if it’s ruminating or “ranking
   people” in my head, gotta pause and redirect.

2. Start with curiosity rather than critique. When someone shows a minor ick, try a mental note:
   “Interesting, why do they do this?” Someone brags about xyz. Instead of “ugh”, it's more “Hmm,
   they value status differently; I probably won’t connect here.”

3. It's important to reinforce positive judgement. When I see green flags, I appreciate them
   explicitly in your mind. So my radar stays constructive, not bitter.

## Cities and Circuses

Is geographical location a key factor when it comes to the kinds of people you experience? According
to PG, different cities whispers different things to you. The kind of conversations you overhear
tell you the kinds of people you are around. Whether I like it or not, it's hard not to be
influenced by those around me. As Feynman once said, **the first principle is that you must not fool
yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool**.

> A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see through windows, in conversations you
> overhear. It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off. One of the
> occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the conversations of people who use
> interrogative intonation in declarative sentences. But on average I'll take Cambridge
> conversations over New York or Silicon Valley ones. [^5]

My efforts weren't futile. I've learnt some lessons along the way which hopefully make this journey
more worthwhile.

1. Start from mutuality, not over-extension. Give small, see if it’s returned. If not, don’t scale
   up. Reciprocity is a foundation, not a reward I earn by overgiving. Look for consistency.

2. Notice small acts. Do they hold space in conversation or bulldoze it? It’s okay to hope people
   will come through. But it’s vital to notice when they don’t.

3. Listen to how they talk about others. Do they describe people with warmth or judgment?

Anyway, this first blog post is in hope of laying down a trail for others to follow, if they want
to. That said, how reliable am I? Any first-person text has a narrator of questionable credibility
because humans tend to rationalise, justify and explain away some of our conduct and decisions.
